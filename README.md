# Meal-Maximizer

Description-> This collaborative project is intended to help Texas A&M University students of all types with the issue of rationing their meal plans so that they last from the beginning to the end of a semester as originally intended. This was a problem that when surveyed, A&M students expressed discontent with, and accordingly we decided to create this backend code to help solve it. 

Installation-> If you want to install this project, we first recommend that you take a look on the Google Play store for our app (tentatively titled Meal Maximizer-TAMU) as we have taken the time to pair our backend code with an attempt at frontend designwork that hopefully users will enjoy. Otherwise, simply download the file named "Meal Maximizer V(current version)" as that'll be the most up to date code that is used in the official app.

Usage-> 
1) If being run via an IDE, simply follow the instructions stated in the output of the code(input necessary inputs) and it will output the relevant results. 
2) If being used from the official app, simply follow what the instructions say on the phone screen and either select your input or type it in depending on your choices. 

Contributing-> If you would like to contribute to this project and have knowledge regarding UI design, Java coding, and/or Android app development
